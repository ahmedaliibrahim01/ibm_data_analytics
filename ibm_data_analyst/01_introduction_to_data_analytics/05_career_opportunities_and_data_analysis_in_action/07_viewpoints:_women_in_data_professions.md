# Viewpoints: Women in Data Professions


In this video, we will listen to women share their experience of being a data professional, and their advice to women aspiring to enter this field. 

As a woman in Data Science, I still run up against the stereotype that this is a man's job. 

I've walked into meetings and had people looked disappointed or confused. 

I take that as an opportunity to prove them wrong. 

This isn't a job just for men, it's for a person who has the insight, the ability, and the drive to get the job done. 

As long as you possess those skills, then there's no reason why anyone can't do anything that they put their mind to. 

Whether you're male or female, whether you are white or black, you have the opportunity to prove people wrong by the work that you produce. 

I would say it can be tough, but you have to find your voice and don't be afraid to use it. 

A lot of times, as women, were not able to find our voice or speak up, or we're afraid of how people will want to treat us if we speak up. 

But it's more important that you be heard and seen, not just being loud or wrong, but if you have the data to back it up, if you have good content and things you want to say, don't be afraid to raise your hand and let people know that you are a thinker and a you can get this done, because that's going to be important as you progress. 

The only real way to get ahead is drive, and people don't know you have drive if you're too quiet. 

If you're just quietly working away in a corner, a lot of times people can't see it. 

Speak up, make sure your voices may heard, make sure you are being seen as a woman who knows how to grow and how to help in the Data Science field. 

When I started, it was mostly men in my class, especially back in grad school. 

But now, I'm seeing that data teams, both data science and data engineering teams, are filled with a lot of women as well. 

I would advise women do continue upskilling.

If they are fond and if they like a career filled with programming, data and problem-solving, then they should continue building their technical skill set, so that they can represent themselves in the landscape of a data professional as strongly as possible? Don't allow your gender to be a crutch. 

Still go hard, put in the work and show the world your amazing talents. 

There are no roles that are set aside for specific genders. 

If you're fortunate enough to work in a profession that you thoroughly enjoy, then go for it.
