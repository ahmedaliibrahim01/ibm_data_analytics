The whole data related profession today has also become very colorful, very dynamic, evolving all the time, and it also presents a lot of range of options to anyone who wants to enter the field of being a data professional. 

It ranges from, if you were to think of various circles as options, starting with a Data Analyst. 

From there you can upscale a lot more become a data scientist. 

You can also become a statistician, which is what I was when I first started off. 

You can then further specialize yourself in a specific direction of data in order to become a data engineer. 

Or you can start by being a BI analyst or a specialist and then don't go to become a data engineer. 

In other words, either you can do a track of Data Analysts and data scientists, or you can do a track of a BI analyst and a data engineer. 

Those are parallel tracks within the data profession.

There are many such roles that anyone interested in the field of data can really take on. 

A few of the most common career options available to Data Analyst is to get deeper into the weeds with Machine Learning and Engineering, and become a Data Scientist or a Machine Learning Engineer that focus more on Machine Learning modeling. 

Other career option available to Data Analyst is to dive deeper into the business they're in and to inform top-level company strategy. 

I think that role is really important and interesting and has really evolved in recent years. 

Another path for a data analyst is to start to become a people manager and manage other Data Analysts and work to triage what gets worked on. 

Because there's always going to be more questions in the organization that can be answered with data than there are people to answer them. 

A Data Manager role can be really interesting and critical in terms of making sure the most important pieces of work actually do get worked on. 

You can be a Bookkeeper. 

You can be an Accountant. 

You could be a CPA. 

You can be a Stockbroker or a Financial Analyst for the government or a lot of large companies. 

You could be a Real Estate Broker. 

Lots of people are great Data Analysts, but to do that you do have to really like numbers and you have to be really detail oriented. 

If that's not you and numbers don't jump off the page at you, Data Analyst might not be the right thing for you.
