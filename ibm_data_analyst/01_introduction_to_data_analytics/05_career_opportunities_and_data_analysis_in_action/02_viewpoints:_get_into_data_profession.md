# Viewpoints: Get into Data Profession

In this video, we will listen to data professionals talk about how they got into this profession. 

My current role as a data professional did not exist before I took the position. 

I realized that there was a need in our company to provide data in a faster, more efficient manner, than going to the IS department who would have a meeting to discuss the meeting, to have requirements, and then they would have an end product that people weren't satisfied with. 

But you had to get at the end of the line and go through the whole process again, to get what you were looking for. 

Through filling a need at the company to provide reports in two weeks, I put together a company database that has access to more information. 

We have analysts that are now able to meet that unmet need in the company. 

I got into the data professional role by chance. 

I was actually working on my PhD in Economics at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, when a colleague of mine suggested that a master's in statistics would also be an excellent value add. 

That's how I got into the statistics program as well in Illinois. 

But once I started that, I was pretty hooked and there was no going back, so to speak. 

In other words, my original goal of becoming an economist actually evolved into a career filled with data, modeling, analytics, insight gathering, communication, visualization, and of course, underlying all of that data-driven problem-solving. 

I got into a data analyst role in a financial data company, actually by accident. 

Back then, my company started to hire equity data analyst in [inaudible] , China, and I was very lucky to join the team, because they were looking for someone who has financial analysis skill sets, which I can bring to the table. 

After that, my team started to hire someone, with technical skill sets like Python, R, and Sickle. 

I've always had a love of numbers. 

One of the things that happens is when you work with numbers so much, they start to tell a story, and the ability to look at those numbers and tell that story is what speaks to me. 

Having always had that level of numbers, either just that always attracted to data analytics and whether it's Excel spreadsheets, or whether it is QuickBooks, or any sort of datasets that can help drive the information that we're looking for, especially in the financial industry where we're looking at profit, and loss, and balance sheet, and what happens when one company buys another company. 

We're always looking at that data to talk to, and speak about the company's history, and in future. 

I got my current role as a data scientist straight out of my grad program, which was a Masters in Data Science. 

Before my grad program, I worked as both a data analyst and an analytics manager.
